### Challenges

- Figuring out how much whitespace is between each section and heading: it can be a challenge when you don't have the exact Figma file for reference. However, this challenge is an opportunity to sharpen your attention to detail.

Once I figured out this solution below, through trial and error ðŸ˜…, everything fell into place when it comes to figuring out the margins in between the sections.

```css
li {
  line-height: 1.5;
  margin-bottom: 8px;
}
```

- Creating the table section proved to be a formidable task for me as well as I didn't know how to remove the borders around it. However through meticulous web searching, stack overflow and mdn docs, I successfully figured out this solution to my problem.

```css
table {
  width: 100%;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
```

Morever, I still quite don't know how to make the horizontal lines thinner ðŸ˜† I have only found solutions to make it thicker.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project. It taught me about the acceptable amount of whitespace in design, among other things. ðŸ˜„
